       <h1>why we need to protect and care animals </h1>
        <p>Animals are very important and necessary in our lives. Animals provides us with many useful things. Also, some pet animals play with us and makes us laugh. But many animals are not taken care. They are beaten and abused by humans. Some are homeless and even do not get proper food.

Many animals die due to eating harmful substances that we throw away with the leftover food items. So, it is very important to dispose the harmful substances properly.

For example : Cows sometimes eats up plastics and other tiny pointed materials along with the grasses which leads them to death.Not only for us, animals are also a very important part of our environment. So, we must take care of them and provide proper food.</P>
